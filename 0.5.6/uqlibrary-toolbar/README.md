# uqlibrary-toolbar
A modern, responsive, and accessible toolbar that provides optional search and menu functionality

TODO: Component page 

For now, try running demo.html for a preview containing a left- and right-drawer surrounding the uqlibrary-toolbar which occupies the centre.
 (assumes it is running in the same filepath as the other uqlibrary components relative to uqlibrary-elements).
